This repository hosts code for training and evaluating a Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model aimed at predicting Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) in biomedical texts. Specifically, our implementation focuses on many-to-one RNNs. The model's performance is evaluated using the DDI extraction 2013 corpus, and a range of evaluation metrics are computed. The code is developed in Python 3.9 and leverages the Torch and Pandas libraries. Its primary purpose is to classify DDIs into one of four distinct classes: 'effect,' 'advise,' 'mechanism,' and 'non-interaction. We omitted the 'int' class due to the limited number of examples.
